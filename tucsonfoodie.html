      What was originally a local Twitter feed searching for the best food in Tucson, turned-online publication, now spotlights popular restaurants, interesting dishes and award-winning chefs.
      Tucson Foodie is a collective of writers and creatives passionate about food.
      And not just passionate about enjoying food, but about supporting local businesses, locally-sourcing ingredients, supporting chefs that challenge our palettes, and sharing their vision of feeding the community.
      On the website you’ll find articles from restaurant openings and menu updates, to food-related events like beer crawls, taco tours, and chef’s table-styled dinners.
      Our readers don’t stay just for our well-written content and beautiful photography by in-house photographer Jackie Tran, but for our mouth-watering, hunger-inducing videos by in-house videographer, me!
      Below are some videos in different formats, from dish/restaurant-focused videos, to sit-down interview style, event recaps, and personal favorites.
      <i>Bon Appétit!</i>
